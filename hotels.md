We are currently in the process of negotiating a reduced group rate for all the various wedding party locations. So **DO NOT book** on Booking.com or other websites! Let us know via email ([Anca](mailto:anca.dmtrch@gmail.com) & [Rik](mailto:rikkid6@gmail.com)) if you would want us to book a room for you, as well as the duration of your stay.

For your trip to Bistri»õa, we recommend you stay at **[Hotel Metropolis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Metropolis/@47.1272607,24.4966106,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x250b9cd755c23bf0?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY_927vZnmAhUMUlAKHa9MDzgQ_BIwFHoECBoQCA)**, which is also the venue of the wedding party on **July 18**.

On **July 19**, the party will move to [Colibi»õa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colibi%C8%9Ba,+Romania/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x474a08e706de8b0d:0x989b7a802680673e?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsh6_bvZnmAhWNb1AKHQxiDwMQ8gEwHnoECBAQBA). There is also the possibility to spend multiple nights there.
