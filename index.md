### 18 July 2020 ❤️ Bistrița, Romania

It's really happening - we are getting married on 18 July 2020! And we want you to be a part of it!  &#x1F600;


We are planning a multi-day event, taking place mostly around Anca's hometown of [Bistrița, Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistri%C8%9Ba). After the wedding, we would also like to organize a **week-long trip around Transylvania** together with all of our friends. Here is our proposed schedule:

* **July 18** : church wedding & wedding party at [Hotel Metropolis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Metropolis/@47.1272607,24.4966106,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x250b9cd755c23bf0?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY_927vZnmAhUMUlAKHa9MDzgQ_BIwFHoECBoQCA), Bistrița

* **July 19** : after-party at the [Colibița](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colibi%C8%9Ba,+Romania/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x474a08e706de8b0d:0x989b7a802680673e?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsh6_bvZnmAhWNb1AKHQxiDwMQ8gEwHnoECBAQBA) mountain resort

* **July 20 - 26** :  post-wedding trip around Transylvania


Please note that, since it may take some time to reach our wedding venue, we recommend you *reserve Friday July 17 for travelling purposes*.
